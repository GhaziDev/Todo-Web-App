# Todo-Web-App
Get a  SECRET_KEY from https://djecrety.ir/ , and put it inside `SECRET_KEY` variable settings.py in backend folder.


install react in `frontend` folder with this command : `npm install react`

As for backend side, the venv folder is already inside the project folder and it has all modules installed, so when you want to run the webserver be sure to activate virtual-env,by doing the following: `path/to/project_folder/backend venv\Scripts\activate` to activate the virtual env


(OPTIONAL) Remember to create an admin account in Django, following this steps:

in terminal/cmd:
```
path/to/folder python manage.py createsuperuser
```

Run the webserver (backend) : ```path/to/folder python manage.py runserver```

then start react app (frontend): ```path/to/folder/main npm start```
